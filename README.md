### Detailed Notes on Protein Structure and Analysis

---

#### **1. Introduction to Protein Structure**
Proteins are polymers of amino acids linked by peptide bonds, folding into specific 3D structures critical for function. Four structural levels define their organization:

- **Primary Structure**: Linear sequence of amino acids connected by covalent **peptide bonds**. Determines higher-order structures.
- **Secondary Structure**: Local folding into **α-helices** (hydrogen bonds between residues 4 apart) and **β-sheets** (hydrogen bonds between adjacent strands). Includes turns and loops.
- **Tertiary Structure**: 3D conformation stabilized by **hydrophobic interactions**, **hydrogen bonds**, **ionic interactions**, **disulfide bridges**, and van der Waals forces. Dictates protein function.
- **Quaternary Structure**: Assembly of multiple polypeptide subunits (e.g., hemoglobin has 4 subunits).

#### **2. Chemical Properties of Proteins**
- **Solubility**: Depends on pH, ionic strength, and solvent. Proteins are least soluble at their **isoelectric point (pI)** due to neutral net charge.
- **Amphoteric Nature**: Act as acids/bases via amino (-NH₂) and carboxyl (-COOH) groups. Buffer near physiological pH.
- **Denaturation**: Loss of structure/function due to **heat**, **pH extremes**, **detergents**, or **chaotropic agents** (urea). Disrupts non-covalent bonds.
- **Color Reactions**:
  - **Biuret Test**: Violet color with Cu²⁺ indicates peptide bonds.
  - **Ninhydrin**: Reacts with free amino groups (blue/purple).
  - **Bradford Assay**: Coomassie dye binds proteins (blue color).
- **Hydrolysis**: Acid/base/enzymatic cleavage into amino acids.

#### **3. Physical Interactions in Protein Stability**
- **Hydrophobic Interactions**: Nonpolar residues cluster inward, driving folding.
- **Hydrogen Bonds**: Stabilize secondary structures (e.g., α-helices).
- **Ionic Interactions**: Attraction between charged side chains (e.g., Lys⁻ and Glu⁺).
- **Disulfide Bonds**: Covalent S-S bonds between cysteine residues (tertiary/quaternary).
- **Van der Waals Forces**: Weak, transient interactions between atoms.

#### **4. Determination of Protein Size**

**a. Sedimentation Analysis**  
- **Ultracentrifugation**: Measures sedimentation velocity (Svedberg units, S).  
  - **Differential Centrifugation**: Separates particles by density/size.  
  - **Density Gradient**: Uses sucrose/cesium chloride gradients for precise separation.  
- **Svedberg Equation**: Relates sedimentation coefficient to molecular weight (MW).

**b. Gel Filtration (Size Exclusion Chromatography)**  
- Porous beads separate proteins by size. Larger proteins elute first (excluded from pores).  
- Calibrated with standards (e.g., cytochrome C, albumin) to estimate MW.

**c. Native PAGE**  
- Non-denaturing electrophoresis. Migration depends on **size**, **charge**, and **shape**.  
- Retains native structure/activity; used for studying protein complexes.

**d. SDS-PAGE**  
- Denatures proteins with **SDS** (uniform negative charge) and **β-mercaptoethanol** (breaks disulfide bonds).  
- Separates purely by size. Migration inversely proportional to log(MW).  
- Common for purity checks and MW estimation (e.g., 10% gel for 15–150 kDa proteins).

#### **5. Determination of Covalent Structures**

**a. Amino Acid Sequencing**  
- **Edman Degradation**: Stepwise removal of N-terminal residues via phenylisothiocyanate. Limited to short peptides (<50 residues).  
- **Mass Spectrometry**:  
  - **MALDI-TOF**: Ionizes peptides, separates by mass/charge (m/z).  
  - **ESI-MS**: Soft ionization for large proteins. Identifies post-translational modifications.  

**b. Peptide Mapping**  
- Digest protein with proteases (e.g., trypsin cleaves after Lys/Arg).  
- Analyze fragments via HPLC or electrophoresis. Reconstruct sequence by overlapping peptides.  

**c. Disulfide Bond Analysis**  
- **Diagonal Electrophoresis**: Compare peptide patterns with/without reduction (β-mercaptoethanol).  
- **Mass Spectrometry**: Identifies linked cysteine residues.  

**d. X-ray Crystallography/NMR**  
- Resolve atomic-level structures but require pure, crystallized samples (X-ray) or small proteins (NMR).

#### **Comparison of Size Determination Methods**

| Method          | Principle                  | Advantages                          | Limitations                          |
|-----------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Sedimentation   | Centrifugal force           | No standards needed; precise        | Expensive; time-consuming            |
| Gel Filtration  | Size exclusion             | Preserves native state              | Affected by shape; requires standards |
| Native PAGE     | Charge/size/shape           | Retains activity                    | Complex migration patterns           |
| SDS-PAGE        | Size (denatured)            | Simple; high resolution             | Destructive; ignores modifications   |

- Size analysis combines physical (sedimentation) and chromatographic/electrophoretic methods.  
- Covalent sequencing relies on chemical/ enzymatic cleavage and advanced spectrometry.
